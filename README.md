# Late-Payment-Analysis-and-Prediction

This is a machine learning prediction model based on the GiveMeSomeCredit dataset on Kaggle. 
It includes data exploration, data cleaning, and prediction from a single model (logistic regression and random forest).

This is an exercise I did in the process of learning the machine learning model. 
Other models and model combinations will be added for exploration later.
